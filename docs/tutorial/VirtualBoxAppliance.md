# Using an existing VirtualBox appliance 
- Get the latest version of VirtualBox
- Get the VirtualBox appliance ( a prepackaged VirtualBox VM) from []() 
- Add a shared folder to the VM
  -  Follow the instructions here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=89HDKvTfR_w
  -  This directory is shared between your guest and host OS
- Start the VM
- The login and password for the VM is : username : `pinball`, password : `pinball`
- Login to the VM and look in `/media` 
  - You will see a directory that has the same name as the shared folder you created - this directory is shared between your guest and host OS
- Goto the shared folder directory under '/media' and clone the PSS_Qualifying repo
  - `git clone https://github.com/AitonGoldman/PSS_Qualifying.git`
  - You can now use an editor on your host OS to edit the PSS_Qualifying files  
- add forwarded port to virtual box - this will let you reach the server from your host OS
  - For the vm, click on the "settings" button
  - under network -> adapter 1, expand the "advanced" options and click the "Port Forwarding" button
  - click on the "plus" icon on the right of the dialog
  - in the new row in the table, enter "8000" into "host port" field and enter "8000" into the "guest port" field
  - click the ok button
  - Now if you run the PSS_Qualifying server on port 8000 in the vm (which is the default), it will be available via port 8000 on the host
